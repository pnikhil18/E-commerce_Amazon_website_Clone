#AMAZON_CLONE
An Amazon clone project created with HTML and CSS is a simplified replica of Amazon's web interface designed  to practice front-end web development.
The project typically includes a main landing page (index.html) with a header featuring a logo, search bar, and navigation menu, a promotional banner,
product categories, featured products, and a footer that provides links to different sections of the site, customer service information, and social media links.
